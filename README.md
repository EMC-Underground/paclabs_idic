Containerized version of Isilon Data Insights Connector for querying and collecting performance statistics from Isilon Clusters

Currently this deploys the standalone collector service, to be used in conjunction with InfluxDB, Grafana and Kapacitor.
These will be developed into similar containerized services and deployed as part of a stack.
